# Optimal Experimental Design with Weibull Models

This project demonstrates optimal experimental design for the **Weibull Extreme-Value Distribution** using R and Quarto.

## Overview
- Goal: Find optimal sample allocation and design parameters.
- Methods: R scripts using advanced statistical models.
- Outcome: Improved efficiency in experiment planning.

## Key Results

```{r}
# Example R code snippet
library(ggplot2)

# Simulated Weibull data
set.seed(123)
x <- rweibull(100, shape = 2, scale = 5)
qplot(x, bins = 20, main = "Weibull Distribution Simulation")
