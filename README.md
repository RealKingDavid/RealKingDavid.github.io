# David K. Amakye â€” Quarto Blog Starter

This is a minimal Quarto website setup, ready to deploy to GitHub Pages. This website is a work-in-progress. You will see changes from time to time till I take this comment away.

## How to publish

1. Make sure Quarto is installed: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/
2. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
quarto render
